1. Intro
In a more practical sense, Ethereum is an internet service platform for guaranteed computation. More than that, as a platform, it provides a set of integral features which are very useful to the developer:
user authentication, via seamless integration of cryptographic signatures
fully customizable payment logic; easily create your own payment system without any reliance on third parties
100% ddos resistant up-time, guaranteed by being a fully decentralized blockchain-based platform
no-fuss storage: forget about having to set up secure databases; Ethereum gives you as much storage as you want
ultimate interoperability: everything in the Ethereum ecosystem can trivially interact with everything else, from reputation to custom currencies
server free zone: your whole application can be deployed on the blockchain meaning no need for setting up or maintaining servers; let your users pay for the cost of their using your service.
