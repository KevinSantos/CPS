### 1. Intro
Today, our personal data, passwords and financial information are all largely stored on other people's computers - in clouds and servers owned by companies like Amazon, Facebook or Google. Even this CoinDesk article is stored on a server controlled by a company that charges to hold this data should it be called upon.
This setup has a number of conveniences, as these companies deploy teams of specialists to help store and secure this data, and remove the costs that come with hosting and uptime.

But with this convenience, there is also vulnerability. As we've learned, a hacker or a government can gain unwelcome access to your files without your knowledge, by influencing or attacking a third-party service - meaning they can steal, leak or change important information.

Blockchain technology, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto with the proof-of-concept implementation of a simple value transfer system known as bitcoin, represents the best digital system we have (after the internet itself) for administering multi-user interactions without any need for centralized coordination or oversight. Effectively, a decentralized system is one that anyone can unilaterally join and participate in, one in which all participants contribute to the running and maintanence, and one in which any participant can unilaterally leave and when they do, the system continues regardless. In a decentralized system, there is no entity that can prevent participation or arbitrarily censor the content or usage. The internet was designed to be decentralized, but the way we use it has become increasingly centralized, to the point where censorship and exclusion are accepted and expected. 

While bitcoin aims to disrupt PayPal and online banking, ethereum has the goal of using a blockchain to replace internet third parties -- those that store data, transfer mortgages and keep track of complex financial instruments.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

In a more practical sense, Ethereum is an internet service platform for guaranteed computation. More than that, as a platform, it provides a set of integral features which are very useful to the developer:
user authentication, via seamless integration of cryptographic signatures
fully customizable payment logic; easily create your own payment system without any reliance on third parties
100% ddos resistant up-time, guaranteed by being a fully decentralized blockchain-based platform
no-fuss storage: forget about having to set up secure databases; Ethereum gives you as much storage as you want
ultimate interoperability: everything in the Ethereum ecosystem can trivially interact with everything else, from reputation to custom currencies
server free zone: your whole application can be deployed on the blockchain meaning no need for setting up or maintaining servers; let your users pay for the cost of their using your service.



### 3. Smart Contracts
At a more abstract level, it is a facility for enabling smart organization, in the sense of groups of entities working together for a particular cause. In the simplest scenario, we have two people working together to achieve a trade. Ultimately, Ethereum could be used to run countries. Somewhere in between there are groups of people wanting to organize baby-sitting circles, film-making collectives, discussion groups, communal houses, etc, and they all have to decide the rules with which they will operate together. Arguably, the harder task is how to implement and enforce the rules, especially given the variety of characters, abilities and motivations that the human race provides.
Crowdfunding is a key example in the advancement organizational tools. It provides a couple of really important functions: a way for individuals to work together for a particular cause (in this case giving a wedge of cash to a person or group) and a mechanism for individuals to interact meaningfully with potentially large companies (such as a games studio).
