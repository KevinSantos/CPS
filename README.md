# Project

* Hash function and smart contracts of Etherium. Explain the hash function for mining Etherium. Explain the signature scheme. Give an example of a contract that can be placed in the blockchain.
1. [Ethereum Github](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining) - The proof of work algorithm used is called Ethash (a modified version of Dagger-Hashimoto) involves finding a nonce input to the algorithm so that the result is below a certain threshold depending on the difficulty.
